# Hotel Customer Segmentation Case Study
Master's project for the Business Cases with Data Science course

### Overview
This repository contains the details of a customer segmentation case study focused on the hotel industry. The case study was presented as part of the "Business Cases with Data Science" course at NOVA Information Management School. The goal is to apply data science techniques to segment customers for a hotel in Lisbon, Portugal.

### Business Situation
#### Case Context
Customer segmentation is essential in every industry to identify groups of customers with different product interests, market participation, or responses to marketing efforts. Understanding these segments helps organizations make informed strategic decisions regarding opportunities, product definitions, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.

Hotel H, located in Lisbon and part of the independent hotel chain C, traditionally used a standard market segmentation based solely on customer origin. However, A, the new marketing manager, recognized the limitations of this approach and sought a more comprehensive segmentation strategy.

### Key Problems
1. **Inadequate Segmentation:** The existing segmentation only considers the sales origin, missing out on other crucial characteristics such as geography, demographics, and behavior.
2. **Strategic Challenges:** Without proper segmentation, it's challenging to define strategies for acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones.
3. **Diverse Distribution Channels:** Different customer types use various booking channels (e.g., direct bookings, travel agencies, OTAs), affecting how the hotel should tailor its marketing and pricing strategies.
